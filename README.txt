^Based off of this, it seems it's developing more as a tiny community project. :)

Fun fact: You can use CapsAdmin's Player Appearance Customizer 3 to give your TF2 character hats/miscs and unusual effects! Note however, his add-on is not affiliated with the TF2 Gamemode, but it's somewhat compatible.
